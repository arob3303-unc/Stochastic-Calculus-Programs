# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Itâ€™s me, Austin.

I am currently reading **_Stochastic Calculus for Finance I_** by Steven E. Shreve.

## ðŸ“š Goal

I plan to work through both textbooks (freely available online).  
Throughout each chapter, Iâ€™ll build a model based on the concepts I learn.  

For example:
- After learning the **Multiperiod Binomial Model**, I created an **Options Pricing Model**.
- In upcoming chapters, Iâ€™ll tackle the **Black-Scholes Model**, and I plan to compare it to the Binomial Model â€”  
  itâ€™ll be interesting to see which performs better!

American options are more complex since they combine multiple approaches (like binomial and Black-Scholes)  
due to the possibility of early exercise. Thatâ€™s part of what makes this project exciting!
