**Hello! It is me Austin.**

I am currently reading *stochastic calculus in finance I* by Steven E. Shreve

**Goal**
===============================================================================================================================

I plan on reading through the first and second textbook (it is free online). 
Throughout each chapter, I plan on making a model from the information I learn.
For example, I learned the multiperiod Binomial Model and I made an Options Pricing model from using it. 
Black-Scholes model will be in future chapters, and I plan on comparing these two models because it'll be interesting to see which is better. American options incorporate many different equations (like binomial model and black-scholes) to find option pricing (excerising early makes it complicated). Anyways... that is the goal and the whole point of this repo!

**Thank you if you made it this far :)**
