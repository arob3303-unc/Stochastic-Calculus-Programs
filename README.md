# Stochastic Calculus for Finance â€” Modeling Project

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Austin.

Iâ€™m currently working through *Stochastic Calculus for Finance I & II* by Steven E. Shreve.

## ðŸ“š About This Repo

This repository is my personal learning project as I study stochastic calculus and quantitative finance.  
For each major topic or model introduced in the textbooks, I build a working Python implementation,  
documenting both the **theory** and the **practical insights** I gain.

My goals:
- Reinforce core concepts in stochastic calculus and financial modeling  
- Compare different pricing methods (e.g., binomial vs. Black-Scholes)  
- Understand strengths, limitations, and assumptions behind each approach  
- Create a portfolio of work I can share with potential employers in quant finance or trading

This is a **work in progress** â€” I will continue updating the repo as I advance through both books.
